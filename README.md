Autonoumous Car Project

Working on adding autonoumous functionality to vehicles following ackermann model.
For this I have forked osrf/car_demo, as that is a well built project and good starting point.

Initial stage(Current Stage): 
Reorganising the project to into different modules. Removing some functionality which I won't be needing like joystick control.
Adding feature for next phase, like switching between manual/auto(noumous) mode, a pid based controller for controlling the vehicle movement(direction and speed) based on throttle, brake and steering parameter.


Future plan explanding this model to include different type of vehicle model.
