Autonomous Car Project

Working on adding autonomous functionality to vehicles following Ackermann model. For this I have forked osrf/car_demo, as that is a well built project and good starting point.

Initial stage(Current Stage): Reorganizing the project to into different modules. Removing some functionality which I won't be needing like joystick control. Adding feature for next phase, like switching between manual/autonomous mode, a PID based controller for controlling the vehicle movement(direction and speed) based on throttle, brake and steering parameter.

Future plan expanding this model to include different type of vehicle model.
